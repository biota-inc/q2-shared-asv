    """
    Return a feature table that contains only ASVs shared by *both* samples
    and whose relative frequency is at least *percentage* in each sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : biom.Table
        Input feature table.
    sample_a : str
        Sample ID of the first sample.
    sample_b : str
        Sample ID of the second sample.
    metadata : qiime2.Metadata
        Sample metadata (required by `filter_samples` when SQL-style
        filtering is used).
    percentage : float, optional
        Minimum relative frequency (0.0 - 1.0) required in every sample
        to retain an ASV. Default is ``0.0001``.

    Returns
    -------
    biom.Table
        The filtered table of shared ASVs. If no ASVs meet the criteria,
        an explicitly empty table with the same sample IDs is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When either ``sample_a`` or ``sample_b`` is not found in *table*.
